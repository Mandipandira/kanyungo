			</div>
			<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; text-align: left; color: brown;">Lake Kariba is amongst the largest man-made lakes in the world and it holds the record in the largest volume of water. For the first-time visitors, the magnitude of this dam is comparable to the size of an ocean. Nowhere else in Africa can one travel such great distances through such a lonely and undisturbed landscape. Wide-sweeping panoramas and beautiful sunsets set against the backdrop of the Zambezi Escarpment make for some of the world's best wildlife images.</p>

				<h2 id="h2">Best Time to visit</h2>
					<p>
						Lake Kariba typically stays warm all year round. The hottest weather occurs throughout the southern hemisphere summer (October to April). Peak humidity coincides with the beginning of the rainy season in October. The rains, which often consist of short, severe afternoon thunderstorms, usually linger into April. The best time to visit Lake Kariba is between May and July. During this time, the weather is dry, calm, and slightly cool. Tiger fishing is good all year on Lake Kariba. The greatest time to go tiger fishing is in early summer (September to December). The rainy season is ideal for birdwatching, whereas the dry season (May-September) is ideal for land-based wildlife viewing. The wet season is ideal for birdwatching, whereas the dry season (May-September) is ideal for land-based wildlife viewing. There is no poor time to visit Kariba; there are simply better periods for certain activities than others.

			</div>
			<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; text-align: left; color: brown;">Mana Pools National Park is a wildlife conservation area and national park in northern Zimbabwe, spanning 219,600 hectares (543,000 acres). It is a section of the lower Zambezi in Zimbabwe where the floodplain transforms into a vast stretch of lakes during each rainy season. As the lakes gradually dry up and recede, the location attracts numerous huge animals in search of water, making it one of Africa's most well-known game-viewing areas.</p>
			<div class="content">

				<h2><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i></h2>
				<h2 id="h2">Best Time to visit</h2>
					<p>
						Zimbabwe is well-known for being a year-round resort, but Mana Pools is an exception. The park is open all year, so you can enjoy true game experiences such as guided game walks, game drives, and game viewing at any time. However, during the rainy season, entrance to certain areas of the park is restricted. It is this "inaccessibility" that has kept this biosphere in such good condition.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The dry season (June to October) provides substantially better animal safari encounters because the bush has thinned down. During the dry season, wildlife frequently congregates on the banks of the Zambezi River to satisfy their thirst. Words simply fail to completely explain the safari experience that the ensemble of extreme isolation, pristine wilderness, and bright.

					</p>
					<p>
					<br />
						Summer is at its peak from December to March, and it rains heavily. In the afternoons, especially on hot days, expect tremendous thunderstorms. In December, the Zambezi River runs low. Because of high water levels, the white-water rafting season often ends in February.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						High water levels frequently force Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool to close in January/February.The best time to visit Vic Falls is between April and June. The Zambezi River is in flood at the moment. As a result, the Falls are at their most stunning, with spray visible for miles.

					Prepare to get soaked! Rainbows are a common feature.The amount of spray and mist might reduce visibility from certain lookouts.July and August are peak seasons at Victoria Falls, with lower water levels and less spray, providing spectacular views of the falls and Livingstone Island, and the rafting season begins as soon as the water level drops to a safe level. Although it is winter in Zimbabwe, you can expect warm and sunny weather.Victoria Falls' dry season runs from September to November, with low water levels. The falls are clearly visible from Zimbabwe, although they may have dried up almost completely on the Zambian side. Livingstone Island and the famous Devil's Pool at the edge of the falls are open during peak white-water river rafting season (Zambia side).

It is a popular hiking destination with magnificent vista’s and many outstanding features which are unique to the area.</p>
			<br />
			<p>An area of rugged grandeur, it is distinguished by large peaks carved from a rifted quartzite block, regarded as an untouched and pristine wilderness which offers both day and multi-day hiking trails, with most of the park only accessible on foot.  The park is riddled with caves and rock overhangs which provide a great “free” alternative to overnight in.

			<p>At the foot of the mountains, Base Camp is home to the Bridal Falls which is within the Eland Sanctuary and has spectacular views of the Porkpie Mountain Range.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>The trails from Corner Camp in the Northern end of the park offer a less physical challenge to walkers and hikers, and the Muhohwa River (and its crocodile free pools) feed the Muhohwa Falls which is an ideal spot for a picnic.
